So, what's special about this version of HSH, how do you use it, what cool features does it have, and so on. First off, for the most part, if you're used to the old HSH, then not much (if any) has changed in how you use the old features. If you only care about that, then everything will continue to work like it always has. For those that want to see what's new, and for those that don't know how to use HSH, read on.",

On the next line is a button create a new home. You just have to replace `<homeName>` with the desired name.\n\nNext are the home list itself, in addition to buttons for teleporting to the home, moving it, inviting someone to it (more on invites later), bringing up residents interface (more on residents later), and finally a button to delete the home.\n\n\nIf there is something you don't quite remember how to do, you can most likely use the home interface to do it.",
